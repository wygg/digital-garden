# New Year's Day: Information Architecture Upgrade & Knowledge System Construction

#public

Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year in 2026, and also the day Antigravity OS—my digital life system—completed its core reconstruction.

In this special moment, instead of visiting relatives and friends as in previous years, I chose to work with my AI pair programming partner, Antigravity, to conduct a thorough upgrade of my personal knowledge base's **"Information Architecture."**

## 1. Why Upgrade?

Over the past two years, my `Library` root directory gradually turned into a cluttered warehouse. Projects like `iPhone Charging Issues`, `Sewer Robots`, and `One Person University` were mixed together. This **"Entropy Increase"** created cognitive resistance every time I opened Obsidian.

I realized that I didn't just need a "place to store notes"; I needed a system that allowed **"Knowing (Study & Think)"** and **"Doing (Action)"** to be both separate and fluid.

## 2. Core Architecture: Unity of Knowledge and Action

With Antigravity's assistance, we reconstructed the root directory into two minimalist sections:

*   **Knowing: `Library_Study-Think`** — The territory of Markdown, responsible for deep thinking and recording.
*   **Doing: `Lab_Action`** — The territory of Python/Code, responsible for experimentation and action.

### 2.1 Library's Semantic Ordering

Inside the Library, we abandoned multi-level physical folders in favor of a flat structure based on a **"Life Cycle Flow,"** using numeric prefixes for forced ordering:

*   **`000_Daily_Note (Life)`**: The time-flow journal of each day; the background color of life.
*   **`100_One_Person_University (Work)`**: Core long-term projects focused on education and self-construction.
*   **`200_AI_Productivity (Research)`**: All AI explorations and experiments.
*   **`800_Digital_Garden (Output)`**: The externally published Digital Garden.
*   **`999_Projects (Archive)`**: An archive for historical projects.

This structure allows me to distinguish at a glance between life, work, and past archives.

## 3. Digital Garden: Breaking the "Silos"

What excites me most is the automated pipeline of the **"Digital Garden."**

In the past, my notes "died" on my local hard drive. Now, through a simple Python script `sync_garden.py`, any note tagged with `#public` is automatically "moved, cleaned, renamed (slugified)," and published to a blog built on Astro.

This is a victory for the **"Hybrid Model"**:
*   **Internal**: I still record journals in folders like `2026/02`, enjoying the security provided by order.
*   **External**: The script automatically "flattens" them into independent topic links, forming a knowledge network.

## 4. Conclusion

From "Blog" to "Garden," and from "Folders" to "Architecture," this is not just a technical reconstruction but a cognitive upgrade.

At this new starting point, I look forward to Antigravity OS carrying more of my crazy ideas and deep reflections in the future.

Happy New Year, my Digital Garden.
