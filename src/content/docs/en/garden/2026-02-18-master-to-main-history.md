# 📅 2026-02-18 Master to Main: Cultural Reconstruction and Reflection in the Code World

## 🎯 Focus
- [x] Understand the historical background of Git's default branch change from `master` to `main` (Gemini Re-study).
- [x] Reflect on the cultural metaphors and social responsibilities behind technical terminology.

## 🧠 Study
> Today's Inputs: Synthesis of dialogue with Gemini regarding the BLM movement and Git renaming.

Today, while initializing a repository with Git, I encountered the hint: `hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch...`. This sparked my curiosity about the relationship between technology and the era.

Through Gemini's synthesis, I learned that:
1.  **Trigger**: The **BLM (Black Lives Matter)** movement of 2020.
2.  **Core Controversy**: Although `master` in Git originally refers to "Master Copy," the long-standing use of **Master/Slave** terminology in computing inevitably evokes historical trauma related to slavery.
3.  **Industry Response**: GitHub CEO Nat Friedman responded to community calls in June 2020, and by October, the default branch for new repositories was officially changed to `main`.
4.  **De-politicization Efforts**: The tech world followed with a terminology sanitization movement:
    *   `Whitelist/Blacklist` -> `Allowlist/Denylist`
    *   `Master/Slave` -> `Main/Replica`

This has become an irreversible **"Political Correctness Industry Standard."**

## 💡 Think
> Today's Reflections:

**Technology is never neutral.**
While code consists of 0s and 1s, the people writing that code live in specific social contexts. A variable name or a branch name subtly reflects the values of that era.

The migration from `master` to `main` might seem to increase maintenance costs for old projects (causing errors in various CI/CD scripts), but in the long run, it embodies the tech community's concept of **"Inclusive Engineering."**

As an individual developer, I may not be able to change the world, but adapting to these changes (like actively initializing `800_Digital_Garden` as `main` today) is not only to avoid technical debt but also a sign of respect for multiculturalism.

## ⚡ Action
> Today's Outputs:

1.  **Enforce `main` as the default branch** in all new repositories within Antigravity OS.
2.  Record this piece of technical history to remind myself to maintain empathy for others even when writing code.
